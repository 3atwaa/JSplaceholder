It's called "The JS placeholder project" genius.......
Usage:

The features we have :

    Example: (imagine there was style tags) .ph{color:red}
  -Auto padding , Width & height inheritance.
  -Works on IE5.
  -No need for server-side verification for such issue, as the text of placeholder is actually a "p" element.
  -It is written in plain JS.
  
Known bugs:
  -in IE (9.10.Edge).
  -please add an inline padding style.
