It's called "The JS placeholder project" genius.......<br />
Usage:<br />
  -add attribute of 'ph' to the specified text box with the wished placeholder....<br />
Example:<br />
  <input type="text" ph="First name." /><br /><br />


The features we have :<br />
  -You can style the placeholder with css using the class "ph".<br />
    Example: (imagine there was style tags) .ph{color:red}<br />
  -Auto padding , Width & height inheritance.<br />
  -Works on IE5.<br />
  -No need for server-side verification for such issue, as the text of placeholder is actually a "p" element.<br />
  -It is written in plain JS.<br />
  
Known bugs:<br />
  -in IE (9.10.Edge)<br />.
  -please add an inline padding style.<br />
